Step 5:

Open up the routes/(categoryPage)  file and import the requireAuthenticatedUser middleware
Add the middleware to both the GET and POST routes.
In each route, extract the user from res.locals and pass them to the list(category data) ForUser and create(entry) 
    methods on the (category page) class. Make sure to also pass the order in the create(entry) method
The GET route should return JSON where the array of orders is stored on the (logged_category) property
The POST route should return JSON where the new order is is stored on the (logged_item *in model*) property
